    "about": "Hi, my name is Alvif Sandana Mahardika. I am a programmer at one of the large FMGC distributor companies in East Java. I am vary interested in mathematics, artificial intelligence, cryptography, back end, and mobile development. I was curious and started to like code since I was in grade 1 junior high school. Two years later I started learning programming languages. I think programming is amazing. I really enjoy when debugging an trying to find a solution for the program I am working on. I am very good at problem solving and enjoy both teamwork and individually.",
